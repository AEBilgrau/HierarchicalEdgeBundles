Hierarchical Edge Bundles in R
------------------------------

This packages implements a crude version of the excellent visualization method of hierarchical edge bundling [1] in R.

## Installation
To install the latest version of **HierarchicalEdgeBundles** directly from the master branch at GitHub, run 

```R
#install.packages("devtools")  # Uncomment if devtools is not installed
devtools::install_github("AEBilgrau/HierarchicalEdgeBundles")
```

The package is still under development and may be considered unstable. Be sure that you have the [package development prerequisites](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/packages/prerequisites) if you wish to install the package from the source.

## Usage

A short tutorial goes here.
